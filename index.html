			<div>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>July 10, 1856</strong> - Nikola Tesla Was Born: Nikola Tesla was born in Smiljan, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. His parents were ethnic Serbians. His father was an Orthodox Priest, and he credited his mother for his inventiveness.</li>
					<li><strong>1875</strong> Tesla Enrolled at Austrian Polytechnic: In 1875, Tesla began to study engineering at the Austrian Polytechnic in Graz, Austria. He claimed to have graduated, but the institution disagrees</li>
					<li><strong>1882</strong>	Worked for Continental Edison In 1882, he went to work for Continental Edison in Paris. He was attempting to improve on electrical equipment sent from the United States.</li>
					<li><strong>1882</strong>	Identified Magnetic Induction Field Principle:Working independently, Tesla identified the rotating magnetic induction field principle. This is used today in alternators.</li>
					<li><strong>1884</strong>	Moved to United States: Tesla moved to the United States in 1884, immediately approaching Thomas Edison with a letter of introduction. According to Tesla, he was offered 50,000 </li>
					<li><strong>1885</strong>	Nikola Tesla Quit Working for Edison;After Edison refused to pay, Tesla quit working for Edison, with the plan and intention of starting his own electrical company.</li>
					<li><strong>1886</strong>	Began Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing: Tesla founded the Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing Company in Rahway, New Jersey. He invented and marketed an arc lamp; however, he earned relatively little off of his investment.</li>
					<li><strong>1887</strong>	War of Currents:The War of Currents began in 1887. Direct current, invented and supported by Edison, was in direct competition with Tesla's alternating current.</li>
					<li><strong>1891</strong>	Patented Tesla Coil: In 1891, Tesla patented the Tesla Coil. The Tesla Coil is a resonant transformer circuit that produced a high voltage, low current and high frequency alternating current electricity.</li>
					<li><strong>1891</strong>	Columbian Exhibition: With the support of the Westinghouse Company, Tesla's alternating current powered the World's Columbian Exhibition. Tesla had offered a lower cost electrical solution.</li>
					<li><strong>1901</strong>	Construction on Wardenclyffe Tower Began: In 1901, construction began on the Wardenclyffe Tower. Tesla believed that he could transmit electrical energy over long distances wirelessly, and the tower would illustrate that. The project was never fully completed.</li>
					<li><strong>August 4, 1915</strong>	Files Suit Against Guglielmo Marconi: On August 4, 1915, Tesla filed suit against Guglielmo Marconi. Marconi is typically credited with radio transmission; however, Tesla accomplished this before Marconi.</li>
					
					<li><strong>1934</strong>	Particle Beam Research: In 1934, the New York Times published Tesla's particle beam research. While he was not financially successful, he continued to be a relatively prominent voice in the scientific community.</li>
					<li><strong>January 7, 1943</strong>	Tesla Died: On January 7, 1943, as World War II raged, Nikola Tesla died in the hotel he made his home. Upon his death, the U.S. government immediately seized his papers and research.</li>
					<li><strong>1960</strong>	A Tesla Was Defined as a Unit of Measurement: In 1960, the scientific community recognized Tesla's achievements by defining a Tesla as a unit of measurement. A Tesla is a unit of magnetic field B.</li>
